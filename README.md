# Minecraft-Realm-Griefer-Tracker
This is a python project I am making that will be useful to Minecraft Realms Plus owners. It will help you find griefers in your world.

# Instructions
First download the latest stable release, in the releases section of this repository. Then if you replace the path variable it will tell you how much of each block type each player has placed. Make sure to click the "Download Latest" button in the World Backups option in your Minecraft Realm. Then change the "path" variable in the code to match your own. Then when you run it, everything should work just fine!

Once you run it you should get a list of each player's UUID and there stats. Now if you have found anything suspicous, like a player having used an unusually high amount of TNT, you can head over to mcuuid.net, so you can identify them. Just paste the player'd UUID in the search bar and then you will see their IGN and skin.
